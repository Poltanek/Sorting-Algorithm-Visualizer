# Sorting-Algorithm-Visualizer
This algorithm visualizer leverages the Tkinter Canvas widget to provide an interactive and intuitive platform for understanding how algorithms work. By animating the step-by-step execution of algorithms, the visualizer illustrates changes in data structures, interactions between algorithmic components, and the progression towards the final solution. The Tkinter Canvas allows for smooth and dynamic visual representations, making complex algorithms easier to grasp and explore.

## Requirements
  - Python 3.11.9
  - Tkinter
  - Visual Studio Code
    
## Features
  - Entry Form
  - Coloured Graphs for appropriate sorting and execution
  - Algorithms: bubble_sort, merge_sort, heap_sort, quick_sort, selection_sort, insertion_sort,
  

## Under Construction
This project is now under some constructions, and docs / UI / functionality may change with updates.
